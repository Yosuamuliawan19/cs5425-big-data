# Problem description

Given an OSM file, you need to extract the nodes (i.e., positions) and edges(roads) information to construct a road graph.

Write an algorithm that can find the (shortest) path between any two nodes in the road graph.
Problem Description

- Algorithm should run within 20 minues of using the SOC cluster
- Should flush the result to the disk

# Construct adjacency list - Output 1

- [ ] You should also sort all the lines in ascending order of the id.

# Construct adjacency list - Output 2

- [ ] For each node, output the directed path in oneline

# OSM data format

- Only focus on node data and road data
